# Javascript Templating

![](https://www.ma-no.org/cache/galleries/contents-1744/460-300/javascript-template-engines.jpg)

it is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic. The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

# Mustache
Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object,
It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.
mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And, since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side.
and looks like:

`Mustache.render(“Hello, ”, { name: “Sherlynn” });
// returns: Hello, Sherlynn`

## ustache-Express
If you intend you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express. Mustache Express lets you use Mustache and Express together easily. To install: With Yarn like:

`$ yarn add mustache-express`

or with NPM:

`$ npm install mustache --save` 

# flexbox
Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).
