# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

![](https://serokell.io/files/tr/opengraph.tr83kzbt.functional-programming-introduction.jpg)

Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## Pure Functions

What makes a function pure? How do we know if a function is pure or not?

Here is a very strict definition of purity:

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

## Referential transparency (Links to an external site.)
if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
```
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency (Links to an external site.)
With this concept, a cool thing we can do is to memoize (Links to an external site.) the function.
```

Strategies There are no absolutes when it comes to clean code — there’s always an edge case!

Return early from functions
Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
Check for Web APIs before implementing your own functionality
